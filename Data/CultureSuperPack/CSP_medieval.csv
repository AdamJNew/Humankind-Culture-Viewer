Historical Background:
Founded by Viking traders and voyagers in the 9th century, the Rusâ€™ were Slavic peoples who traded and settled along the many river routes connecting the Baltic and Black Seas. With religious influence from the Byzantine Empire, the Rusâ€™ were eventually converted to Christianity and adopted many classically Byzantine cultural and religious traditions. Though the Rusâ€™ eventually splintered into many competing states, their empire was the first to unite the East Slavs and many later states have claimed descent from the empire.
